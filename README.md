This simple project was done a while ago on a different computer and it seems I hadn't created a repository for it and so I've redone it.

This however gave me the opportunity to take a test driven approach toward the problem. I wrote up all the tests before any coding was done. 

I felt the biggest benefit to this approach was that it kept me focused on a single task at a time. It was also easy to spot bugs along the way.
